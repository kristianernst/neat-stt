# neat-stt üéôÔ∏è

A modern speech-to-text (STT) and note-taking service.
This project combines state-of-the-art machine learning models with a beautiful, responsive user interface.

Built and developed for Silicon Macs (I have an M1 Max), but should work on other platforms as well.

How it works on a very simple level:

  a["audio"] --> b["neat-stt"]
  b --> c["diarized transcript and notes"]
```
