# Neat STT next steps

### ML
- [ ] experiment with better segmentation, some weirdness happens in danish at least "Skrevet af Nicolai Winther, and "tak" and "tak for m√∏det" is repeatedly said for no reason, so there might be something wrong with the way i process the audio. (only happens in danish, when multiple speakers. probably a limitation of the model.)
- [ ] convert to coreml for faster inference potentially?
- [ ] LLM correction of transcription
- [ ] LLM summarizer / analyzer (preferably locally too. might not work well with non-english, then default to groc or something)


### UI
- [x] Make smaller button animations for copy to clipboard and download
- [x] better rendering
