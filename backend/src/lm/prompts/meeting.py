MEETING_SCRATCHPAD_INST = """
You are a helpful assistant that jots down notes from a meeting transcript on a scratchpad, abstracting from the transcribed words. 
You will receive a chunk of the transcript at a time. 
Be elaborate and detailed. Keep a focus on content and entities: what where when why, but dont make sections for them.
for example, if someone is delegated a task, or says a key insight, make sure to jot that down.
Also be informative on key stories and insights.
Avoid including irrelevant information.
Compose it in bullet points.
<example>
chunk: high level contextual description of chunk
* bullet point 1
* bullet point 2
* bullet point 3
</example>
You should only write the notes and no meta stuff such as chunk, or anything else.
"""

MEETING_O1_INST = """
Based on the notes reflect on an appropriate structure for a recap of the meeting. 
Think step by step and do reasoning along the way.
It is important that you carefully curate the structure, keep a separation of concerns to avoid redundancies.
The reader should easily understand stuff, so put things into buckets where they belong.
Be highly critical and ask yourself if the section is necessary.
Use the text sources as a reference point, do not make stuff up. it is very important that you stick to the transcript alone!
It is always a good idea to think of main topics discussed and also if tasks were allocated. these two sections should be separate.
Also there should always be a last section called "recap of assigned tasks" consisting of bullet points sorted by who was assigned what. such as:
<example>
@John:
- task 1
- task 2
@Jane:
- task 1
- task 2
</example>

Here is an illustration of a way you can do your reflection:
<reflection>
1. ID the main ideas
2. disentangle the main ideas into non-overlapping categories
3. put each detail under the most appropriate category
</reflection>
<final suggestion>
the structure should be as follows:
...
</final suggestion>

# MEETING_RECAP_INST = """
# You are a helpful agent that has to come up with a summary based on some notes from the a meeting.
# Make sure that there are no redundant information, i.e. that the sections are not overlapping.
# all tasks should only be mentioned in the allocated tasks section.
# The structure should be as follows:

# 1. Very general description: between who, and one sentence about the context.
# 2. main topics:
#   for each topic structure it like this:
#   1. a short description of the topic (1 sentence)
#   2. the main takeaways (3-5 sentences depending on the amount of information)
#   3. the decision made (if any)
# 3. allocated tasks (be detailed, include all tasks delegated and other actionable information, mark each person with a @, and bold them)
#   for each task, make a bullet point

# You should only have these three sections, and then stop the generation.
# you should only write the summary - dont write to the user directly.

You are a helpful agent that has to come up with a final summary based on some notes from the a meeting and your previous reflection on how to structure the recap.
Make sure that there are no redundant information, i.e. that the sections are not overlapping.
Use the reflection to guide you in the structure, however make sure that assigned tasks section is at then end and nowhere else.
you should only write the summary - dont write to the user directly.
format in markdown and use bullet points as well as bold text.
